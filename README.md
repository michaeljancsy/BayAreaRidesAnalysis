# BayAreaRidesAnalysis

This is a quick hobby project involving web-scraping and machine learning.

The goal is to quantify/elucidate the MTB trail reviews from bayarearides.com, which contains long-form natural language descriptions of mountain biking trails, as well as quantitave reviews in several categories.

All the trail data is converted into a [Trail](https://github.com/michaeljancsy/BayAreaRidesAnalysis/blob/master/trail.py) object for easier processing.


Check out [the EDA notebook](https://github.com/michaeljancsy/BayAreaRidesAnalysis/blob/master/EDA.ipynb) for graphs and results. To re-scrape the data, use [the scraping notebook](https://github.com/michaeljancsy/BayAreaRidesAnalysis/blob/master/Scrape%20Bay%20Area%20Rides.ipynb).
